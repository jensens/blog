# Yenzenz Brain Log

This is my (Jens W. Klein) personal brain log, primary written to be useful for my future-self, to be found by some search-engine.
It is a collection of how-to, notes, thoughts, ideas, and other things that I want to remember.
As a side effect, it is also a place to share my knowledge with others.

The primary language here is English, specially for technical topics.
Some articles are in German, as this is my native language.

My nickname, originating somewhere in the early 90ies, is Jensens or in English Yenzenz.
It is pronounced like "Yen" and "Cents" (or "Sense").
