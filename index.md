# ¥¢¢ Brain Log

**[J|Y]en[s|z]en[s|z]**

This is my personal brain log, primary written to be useful for my future-self, to be found by some search-engine.
It is a collection of how-to, notes, thoughts, ideas, and other things that I want to remember.
As a side effect is also a place to share my knowledge with others.
