# A Blog Again

After I blogged a while here and there, on services died and I lost my content, I decided to blog again.

This time on my own, as a static site, with a simple toolchain, distributed with git on my GitLab and GitHub and hosted on GitHub Pages on my domain.
But if GitHub goes crazy some day, I can move the content to another hoster, or even host it myself.

I use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org), a static site generator, that is mainly used for documentation.
With [MyST Parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) I write all my articles in Markdown.
With the [Ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) extension I can use it as a simple blog.
An my favorite sphinx theme, [Pydata-Sphinx-Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/), makes it look nice.

Overall the setup is kept very simple.
Publishing happens with a simple GitHub Actions workflow.

So, lets write things down, that I want to remember, and share it with my future self and the world.
